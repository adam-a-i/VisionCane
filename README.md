# SmartCane

## Overview
SmartCane is an advanced navigation cane designed to assist visually impaired individuals. It utilizes real-time camera input, GPS navigation, and voice interaction to provide a seamless and safe navigation experience. The system detects obstacles, differentiates between stationary and moving objects, and offers timely guidance using voice feedback.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Identifies obstacles and determines their distance.
- **Hazard Warnings**: Alerts the user about curbs, stairs, and moving objects.
- **GPS Navigation**: Provides step-by-step directions to destinations.
- **Offline GPS Support**: Ensures navigation without internet dependency (Work in Progress).
- **Voice Control**: Users can configure settings and control navigation via voice commands.
- **Continuous Updates**: Adjusts guidance dynamically as the environment changes.
- **Calm and Confident Voice Feedback**: Ensures clear and reassuring instructions.

## How It Works
1. The SmartCane uses a camera to analyze the user's surroundings.
2. AI-powered processing detects objects, calculates their distance, and determines movement.
3. The system provides real-time spoken feedback on obstacles and navigation directions.
4. Users can interact with the cane using voice commands.
5. GPS assists with navigation, with an offline mode currently in development.

## Installation
### Requirements
- Embedded processing unit (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or equivalent)
- Camera module
- GPS module
- Microphone & speaker
- Rechargeable battery pack
- Supporting software (AI model, GPS software, voice processing)

### Setup
1. Assemble the hardware components.
2. Install the necessary software packages.
3. Configure object detection and GPS navigation.
4. Test the voice interaction system.
5. Optimize for real-world conditions.

## Usage
- **Starting Navigation**: Activate the cane and set a destination via voice input.
- **Receiving Alerts**: Listen for real-time obstacle warnings and movement updates.
- **Adjusting Settings**: Modify configurations using voice commands.
- **Offline Mode**: Enable offline GPS (once implemented).

## Roadmap
- **Improve Offline GPS Functionality**: Enhance location accuracy without internet.
- **Refine Object Detection**: Increase efficiency in distinguishing objects.
- **Optimize Battery Usage**: Extend operational hours.
- **Expand Voice Commands**: Provide more intuitive control options.
